Machine Learning - Multiple Regression


Coefficient

The coefficient is a factor that describes the relationship with an unknown variable.

Example: if x is a variable, then 2x is x two times. x is the unknown variable, and the number 2 is the coefficient.

In this case, we can ask for the coefficient value of weight against CO2, and for volume against CO2. The answer(s) 
we get tells us what would happen if we increase, or decrease, one of the independent values.

'''
import pandas
from sklearn import linear_model


df = pandas.read_csv("./6-machine-learning/files/data.csv")  # from py3-00-w3schools

X = df[['Weight', 'Volume']]
y = df['CO2']

regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
regr.fit(X, y)

# Print the coefficient values of the regression object:
print(regr.coef_)

Result Explained


The result array represents the coefficient values of weight and volume.

Weight: 0.00755095
Volume: 0.00780526

These values tell us that if the weight increase by 1kg, the CO2 emission increases by 0.00755095g.

And if the engine size (Volume) increases by 1 cm3, the CO2 emission increases by 0.00780526 g.

I think that is a fair guess, but let test it!

We have already predicted that if a car with a 1300cm3 engine weighs 2300kg, the CO2 emission will be approximately 107g.

What if we increase the weight with 1000kg?

'''
# Taking the previous example:
predictedCO2 = regr.predict([[3300, 1300]])

print(predictedCO2)


'''
We have predicted that a car with 1.3 liter engine, and a weight of 3300 kg, will release approximately 115 grams of CO2 for every kilometer it drives.

Which shows that the coefficient of 0.00755095 is correct:

107.2087328 + (1000 * 0.00755095) = 114.75968
