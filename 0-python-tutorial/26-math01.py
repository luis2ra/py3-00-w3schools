Python Math


Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive "math" module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.


Built-in Math Functions

The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable.

The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:

The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (x ^ y).

'''
# Example of min() and max() functions
x = min(5, 10, 25)
y = max(5, 10, 25)

print(x)
print(y)


# Example of abs() function
a = abs(-7.25)

print(a)


# Example of pow() function
p = pow(4, 3)

print(p)
