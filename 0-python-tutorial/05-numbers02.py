Python Numbers


There are three numeric types in Python:

* int
* float
* complex

Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them.

To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function.

'''
# Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
