Python User Input - User Input


Python allows for user input.

That means we are able to ask the user for input.

The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7.

Python 3.6 uses the input() method.

Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.

The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen.

Note: Python stops executing when it comes to the input() function, and continues when the user has given some input.

'''

# Python 3.9
username = input("Enter username: ")
print("Username is: " + username)
