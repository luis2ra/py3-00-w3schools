Python Variables


Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.


Creating Variables

Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set:

'''
# Example
x = 4           # x is of type int
x = "Sally"     # x is now of type str
print(x)
