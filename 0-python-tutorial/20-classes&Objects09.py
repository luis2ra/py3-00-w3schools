# Demo Python Classes and Objects - The pass Statement
'''
The pass Statement

class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

'''
# Example:
class Person:
  pass

# having an empty class definition like this, would raise an error without the pass statement
