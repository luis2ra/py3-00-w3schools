The Length of an Array

Use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements in an array).

Note: The length of an array is always one more than the highest array index.

# Return the number of elements in the cars array:
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]

x = len(cars)

print(x)
