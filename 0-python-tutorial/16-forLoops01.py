Python For Loops

A "for" loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the "for" keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in 
other object-orientated programming languages.

With the "for" loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

# Print each fruit in a fruit list:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in fruits:
    print(x)
