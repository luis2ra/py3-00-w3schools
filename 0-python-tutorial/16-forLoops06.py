The range() Function

To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,

The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

Note that range(7) is not the values of 0 to 7, but the values 0 to 6.

'''
# Using the range() function:
for x in range(7):
    print(x)
print("the end...")
