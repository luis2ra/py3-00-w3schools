Python Numbers


There are three numeric types in Python:

* int
* float
* complex

Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them.

To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function.

'''
# Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
