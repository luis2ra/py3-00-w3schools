Removing Array Elements - Part 2

You can also use the remove() method to remove an element from the array.

Note: The list's remove() method only removes the first occurrence of the specified value.

'''
# Delete the element that has the value "Volvo":
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]

cars.remove("Volvo")

print(cars)
