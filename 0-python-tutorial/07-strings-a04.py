Strings are Arrays

Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

# Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):
a = "Hello, World!"
print("string original: ", a)
print("caracter de la posición 1: ", a[1])
