Python Lambda

A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.


Syntax

    lambda arguments : expression

The expression is executed and the result is returned:

'''
# Add 10 to argument a, and return the result:
x = lambda a: a + 10
print(x(5))
