# Convert from one type to another:

x = 1   # int
y = 2.8 # float
z = 1j  # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)

#convert from float to complex:
d = complex(y)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
