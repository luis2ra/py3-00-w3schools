Multi Words Variable Names

Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:
* Camel Case
* Pascal Case
* Snake Case

Camel Case: Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter.

Example:
myVariableName = "John"


Pascal Case: Each word starts with a capital letter.

Example:
MyVariableName = "John"


Snake Case: Each word is separated by an underscore character.

Example:
my_variable_name = "John"

'''
myVariableName = "John"
MyVariableName = "John"
my_variable_name = "John"

print(myVariableName)
print(MyVariableName)
print(my_variable_name)
