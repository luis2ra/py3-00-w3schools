Python Variables - Output Variables


The python print() function is often used to output variables.

You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables.

However, for numbers the + character works as a mathematical operator.

# You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables.
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)  # The output is "Pythonisawesome"

# For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
p = 5
q = 10
print(p + q)  # The output is 15
