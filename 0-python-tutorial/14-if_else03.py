# Demo Python If ... Else - Elif

Elif

The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

'''

# In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, 
# but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".

a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")
