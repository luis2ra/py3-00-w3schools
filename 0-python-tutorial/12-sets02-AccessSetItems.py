Python Sets - Access Set Items


Access Items

You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.

But you can loop through the set items using a 'for' loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the 'in' keyword.

'''
# Loop through the set, and print the values:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
for x in thisset:
    print(x)


# Check if "banana" is present in the set:
print("banana" in thisset)


'''
Change Items


Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.
