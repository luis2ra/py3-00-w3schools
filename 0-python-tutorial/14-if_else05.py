# Demo Python If ... Else - Short Hand If ... Else
'''
Short Hand If ... Else

If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:

'''
# One line if else statement:
a = 2
b = 330

print("A") if a > b else print("B")  # This technique is known as Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions.
