Python Try Except - Else


You can use the "else" keyword to define a block of code to be executed if no errors were raised:

'''
# The "try" block does not raise any errors, so the "else" block is executed:
try:
    print("Hello")
except:
    print("Something went wrong")
else:
    print("Nothing went wrong")
