Python Arrays

Note: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.


Arrays

Note: This page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.

Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable:
'''
# Create an array containing car names:
fruits = ["Orange", "Pear", "Apple"]

print(fruits)


'''
What is an Array?

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:
car1 = "Ford"
car2 = "Volvo"
car3 = "BMW"

However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

# Create an array containing car names:
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]

print(cars)
