# Demo List Comprehension

List Comprehension

List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.


The Syntax

    newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]

The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.

Condition: The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to True.

Note: The condition is optional and can be omitted.


Iterable

The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc.


Expression

The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome, 
which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new list.

Note: The expression can also contain conditions, not like a filter, but as a way to manipulate the outcome.

# Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.
# Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []
for x in fruits:
    if "a" in x:
        newlist.append(x)
print(newlist)


# With list comprehension you can do all that with only one line of code:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango", "uva"]
list_comprehension = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
print(list_comprehension)


# Only accept items that are not "apple":
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != "apple"]
print(newlist)


# With no if statement:
fruits_plus = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango", "uva", "pi√±a"]
list_comprehension2 = [x for x in fruits_plus]
print(list_comprehension2)


# You can use the range() function to create an iterable:
newlist = [x for x in range(10)]
print(newlist)


# Example accept only numbers lower than 5:
newlist = [x for x in range(10) if x < 5]
print(newlist)


# Set the values in the new list to upper case:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x.upper() for x in fruits]
print(newlist)


# Set all values in the new list to 'hello':
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = ['hello' for x in fruits]
print(newlist)


# Return "orange" instead of "banana":
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x if x != "banana" else "orange" for x in fruits]
print(newlist)
