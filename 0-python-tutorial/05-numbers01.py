Python Numbers


There are three numeric types in Python:

* int
* float
* complex

Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them.

To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function.

'''
# Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
