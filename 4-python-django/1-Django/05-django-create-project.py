Django Create Project


My First Project

Once you have come up with a suitable name for your Django project, like mine: my_tennis_club, 
navigate to where in the file system you want to store the code (in the virtual environment), 
I will navigate to the myworld folder, and run this command in the command prompt:

$ django-admin startproject my_tennis_club

'''
print("Django Create Project")
