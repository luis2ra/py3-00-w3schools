Django URLs


Create a file named my_tennis_club/members/urls.py in the same folder as the views.py file.

The urls.py file you just created is specific for the members application. We have to do some routing 
in the root directory my_tennis_club as well. This may seem complicated, but for now, just follow the instructions below.

There is a file called urls.py on the my_tennis_club folder, open that file and add the include module in the import statement, 
and also add a path() function in the urlpatterns[] list, with arguments that will route users that comes in via 127.0.0.1:8000/.
