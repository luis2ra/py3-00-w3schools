Django Create App


What is an App?

An app is a web application that has a specific meaning in your project, like a home page, a contact form, or a members database.

In this tutorial we will create an app that allows us to list and register members in a database.

But first, let's just create a simple Django app that displays "Hello World!".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create App

I will name my app "members".

Start by navigating to the selected location where you want to store the app, in my case the my_tennis_club folder, and run the command below.

If the server is still running, and you are not able to write commands, press [CTRL] [BREAK], or [CTRL] [C] to stop the server and 
you should be back in the virtual environment.

$ py manage.py startapp members

'''
print("Django Create App")
