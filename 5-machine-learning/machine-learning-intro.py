Machine Learning

* Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
* Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).
* Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.


Where To Start?

* In this tutorial we will go back to mathematics and study statistics, and how to calculate important numbers based on data sets.
* We will also learn how to use various Python modules to get the answers we need.
* And we will learn how to make functions that are able to predict the outcome based on what we have learned.
