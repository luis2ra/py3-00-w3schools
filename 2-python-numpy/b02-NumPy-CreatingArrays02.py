'''
Dimensions in Arrays

* A dimension in arrays is one level of array depth (nested arrays).
* nested array: are arrays that have arrays as their elements.


0-D Arrays

* 0-D arrays, or Scalars, are the elements in an array. Each value in an array is a 0-D array.

1-D Arrays

* An array that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array.

2-D Arrays

* An array that has 1-D arrays as its elements is called a 2-D array.

3-D Arrays

* An array that has 2-D arrays (matrices) as its elements is called 3-D array.


Check Number of Dimensions?

* NumPy Arrays provides the ndim attribute that returns an integer that tells us how many dimensions the array have.
