# Demo python variables - Creating Variables
'''
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
x = 4           # x is of type int
x = "Sally"     # x is now of type str
print(x)
