Tuple

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.


Tuple Methods
Python has two built-in methods that you can use on tuples.

count()	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
index()	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
