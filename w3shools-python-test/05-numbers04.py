# Demo Python Numbers - Complex
'''
There are three numeric types in Python:

* int
* float
* complex

Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them.

To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function.

# Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:

x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
