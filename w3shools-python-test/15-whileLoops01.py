Python Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

* while loops
* for loops


Python While Loops

With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true.

The continue Statement
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.

The else Statement
With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.
