# Demo python variables - Creating Variables
'''
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
'''

# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
x = "John"
print(x)
#double quotes are the same as single quotes:
y = 'John'
print(y)
