Python Dates

A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to work with dates as date objects.


Date Output

When we execute the code from the example above the result will be:
2020-01-26 14:21:59.952569

The date contains year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.

The datetime module has many methods to return information about the date object.


The strftime() Method

The datetime object has a method for formatting date objects into readable strings.

The method is called strftime(), and takes one parameter, format, to specify the format of the returned string.
