Python Classes/Objects

Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.


Create a Class

To create a class, use the 'class' keyword.

'''

# Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
class MyClass:
    x = 5

# la siguiente sentencia imprime el objeto class '__main__.MyClass'
print(MyClass)
